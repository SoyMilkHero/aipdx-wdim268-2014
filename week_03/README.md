Amazon.com

I first wanted to use GoodUI.org, because i thought it would be fun to poke fun at it when it falls apart without javascript or css,
but as it turns out, it's not too bad. So that's no fun, let's use Amazon.com instead.

I love Amazon. They've done a great job organizing all their content (and they have A LOT of content). With both Javascript and CSS active,
they've got a really good looking website. So i was interested to see what happens to all that mass of content when Javascript and CSS
are turned off.

When you turn off javascript the page doesn't really change, it's almost the same as before. You loose the slideshows, and clickable
scrolling, but other than that, it's basiclly the same website. No big deal. You might actually be suprised how little Javascript is coded
into Amazon, i expected wayy more.

Now when you turn CSS off, all hell breaks loose. But in an interesting way. 

All the images amazon uses all sit at the top of the CSS-less page, including rollover states, different countries versions
of the Amazon logo, and background gradients. 

Followed by (?) i guess those are ads?

Then Best Sellers, which, the Best sellers section works quite well still. It still has some sense
of hierarchy, even without css. Retains the images of the product in question, and basiclly kind of looks like 
craigslist.

With the exception of a few big ads, for albums, apps, games etc. Amazon.com turns into craigslist with CSS off.
For the most part, everything still works, it's definetly not pretty, but all the information that was there before
is still there, and you could still buy your stuff on here without too much issue. 

Web Stack:

I wouldn't say i'm an expert at HTML by any means, but i've spent a good amount of time writing HTML, and i've looked at plenty, 
but this is crazy. It's followable, but amazon's mass of content really shows in the HTML code. It's pretty cramped in here yo.

I'd say the same about myself and CSS, not an expert, but more or less experienced with it. The CSS of Amazon though is a few levels
over my head, also crowded in here yo.

Apperently i didn't look hard enough above, when i said that there isn't very much Javascript. There is AN EFF TON of Javascript. It just 
doesn't really effect the look of the website, just the functionality. Which makes sense, I can imagine theres a lottt of backend
stuff that has to go on to populate a Amazon template, and buying, and all that stuff.
